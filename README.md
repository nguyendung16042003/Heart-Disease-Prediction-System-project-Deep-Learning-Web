Heart Disease Prediction System project(Deep Learning Web)

üìä Project Summary¬∂
1. Introduction


This project develops a system for predicting heart disease risk based on patient medical data. It utilizes Deep Learning (Artificial Neural Network - ANN) to analyze health factors and provide risk predictions.

2.Technologies Used
 
‚Ä¢	Machine Learning / Deep Learning: TensorFlow, Keras

‚Ä¢	Data Processing: Pandas, NumPy

‚Ä¢	Web Framework: Flask

‚Ä¢	Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

‚Ä¢	Database: SQLite / MySQL

‚Ä¢	Deployment: FastAPI, Docker

3.Dataset

‚Ä¢	The dataset consists of 1,025 samples with 14 medical features, including: 

  - age (Age), sex (Gender), cp (Chest Pain), chol (Cholesterol), thalach (Max Heart Rate), oldpeak (ST Depression), thal (Thalassemia index), etc.

  -	"target" column: The prediction outcome (0: No disease, 1: Has heart disease).

4. System Workflow

1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Preprocessing: Cleaning, normalizing, and handling missing data.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Model Training: Using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to learn from medical data.9

3Ô∏è‚É£ Prediction & Evaluation: Testing the model on new data and optimizing results.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Web Deployment: Users enter their health data on the web, and the system predicts heart disease risk.

üìä Model Development (ANN)

1.Importing essential libraries for data processing, visualization, machine learning, and deep learning.

Data Handling & Visualization: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn

3.Model Training: Fits the best model on training data.

- LogisticRegression

Prediction: Generates predictions on test data.

Confusion Matrix: Visualizes model performance with a heatmap.

Evaluation: Calculates accuracy and prints a classification report.

üìä Build The Website 

1.Main

This code sets up a Flask-based web app for heart disease prediction, handling data with pandas/numpy and loading a pre-trained model with TensorFlow.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/16f8c28d-5cf5-4030-a1f5-74ba61a5e28d)

This code loads a pre-trained machine learning model from the file "model.h5" using TensorFlow's load_model function.

This Flask application provides a heart disease prediction web service:

index(): Renders the homepage (trangchu.html).

nhapthongtin(): Handles form submission (GET/POST). Converts user input into a DataFrame and predicts heart disease using a trained model. Redirects to the results page.

du_doan(): Processes POST requests for prediction. Converts input to DataFrame, makes a prediction, and renders the results (trangkqduketqua.html).
