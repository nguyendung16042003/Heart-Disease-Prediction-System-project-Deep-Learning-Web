Heart Disease Prediction System project(Deep Learning Web)

üìä Project Summary¬∂
1. Introduction


This project develops a system for predicting heart disease risk based on patient medical data. It utilizes Deep Learning (Artificial Neural Network - ANN) to analyze health factors and provide risk predictions.

2.Technologies Used
 
‚Ä¢	Machine Learning / Deep Learning: TensorFlow, Keras

‚Ä¢	Data Processing: Pandas, NumPy

‚Ä¢	Web Framework: Flask

‚Ä¢	Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

‚Ä¢	Database: SQLite / MySQL

‚Ä¢	Deployment: FastAPI, Docker

3.Dataset

‚Ä¢	The dataset consists of 1,025 samples with 14 medical features, including: 

  - age (Age), sex (Gender), cp (Chest Pain), chol (Cholesterol), thalach (Max Heart Rate), oldpeak (ST Depression), thal (Thalassemia index), etc.

  -	"target" column: The prediction outcome (0: No disease, 1: Has heart disease).

4. System Workflow

1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Preprocessing: Cleaning, normalizing, and handling missing data.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Model Training: Using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to learn from medical data.9

3Ô∏è‚É£ Prediction & Evaluation: Testing the model on new data and optimizing results.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Web Deployment: Users enter their health data on the web, and the system predicts heart disease risk.
